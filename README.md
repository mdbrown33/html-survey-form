# freeCodeCamp HTML Certification Project

This is my submission for the HTML certification project on freecodecamp.org. HTML is the first course toward the Responsive Web Design Certification, which in itself is also a section of the Certified Full Stack Developer Curriculum. I have listed the link to the project prompt, example survey form, project instructions, and user stories that must be included in the project. **By design, will not save or submit user input.**

Instructions: Build an app functionally similar to this example project. Try not to copy the example project, give it your own personal style.
